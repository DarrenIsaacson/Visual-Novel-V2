Finally....
After spending countless hours grinding away at my software development project.
I feel that I may have eased some of the stressed that is drilling within my being.
Currently....... I spent the last 3 days trying my best to take all the information from the
book \"Java Game Development with LibGDX\" written by Lee Stemkoski, and man do I feel like I wasted a lot of time.
The difficulty and and complexity of the book makes my head hurt......................................
But even then, I feel more ambitious to try my best, even if I loose out on obtaining the grade I want.
Who know's.......... Personally, I think this can be a really big eye opener.............
It may not be necessarily the greatest project but I feel that it would also interest some people who are
looking to also get into some form of game development .....
.....
Hopefully I can prove that it was worth all of the hassle.
I mean I have a decent idea on how I want to do it but it will be a lot of learning that I am not totally prepared for...
Right now all I want to do is imagine.
Imagine the snow falling in the middle of the woods.

Imagining every single snowflake, gliding in the sky. Soaring in the wind.................
And as the snowflake hits my face, I come to the realization that the snow isn't cold. Its... Warm
..................
I just want to stay here
..................
I am comforted by the snow.
..................
Just... Keep me here.............

# Visual-Novel-V2 (Java Final using LibGdx)

This is a visual novel that is created using LibGdx. LibGdx is a open sourced, cross platform game development framwork that is community driven. 

## Requirements

There are only a few requirements that you will need to easily run this project. 

- First you will need intelliJ. I currently am using the ultimate edition, but the community edition should suffice. 
- You will need java 8 or above.

## Installation

Once you cloned the repository to your Intellij, One of the first things you want to do is open the project tab on your left -> click on the desktop folder -> click on the src folder -> click on the com.mygdx.game.desktop folder -> open the DesktopLauncher Class.

Once you have the DesktopLauncher class open, right next to the hammer there is a add/edit configurations button, click on that. 

Another window should pop up, here we need to set this class as a application configuration. Click on the + sign, look for application and open application.

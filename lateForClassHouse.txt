Ouch....
Awe man.
I think I may have fell out of the bed..
*Scratches head* What time is it.............
10:30! Oh no! I have class at 11!

Normally it takes me 30 minutes to get ready in the morning and it takes me 30 minutes to get to school!!
I really dont want to go to school smelling bad! What should I do!

(Rose) You are totally so lucky that I didn't have school today. All of my finals happen to be finished.
Honestly, I thought I had the alarm set for the right time.
(Rose) Conveniently, we live 10 min away. So this will be a quick ride.
Exactly. Thanks again for the ride today.
(Rose) No problem.
(Rose) We are here now. Ill see you later!
